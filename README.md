What is Terraform 

Terraform is our tool of choice to manage the entire life cycle of infrastructure using infrastructure as code. 
That means declaring infrastructure components in configuration files that are then used by Terraform to provision,
adjust and tear down infrastructure in various cloud providers.


Commands :

terraform init
terraform plan
terraform plan -out config.terraform
terraform apply config.terraform
